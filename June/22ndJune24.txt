/*

Extract the Number from the String

Given a sentence containing several words and numbers. Find the largest number among them which does not contain 9. If no such number exists, return -1.

Examples :

Input: sentence="This is alpha 5057 and 97"
Output: 5057
Explanation: 5057 is the only number that does
not have a 9.
Input: sentence="Another input 9007"
Output: -1
Explanation: Since there is no number that
does not contain a 9,output is -1.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxillary Space: O(n)

Constraints:
1<=n<=106
1<=answer<=1018

n is the length of a given sentence
