Question :

Find the Highest number

Given an integer array a[] of size n, find the highest element of the array. The array will either be strictly increasing or strictly increasing and then strictly decreasing.

Note: a[i] != a[i+1] 

Example 1:

Input:
11
1 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1
Output: 
6
Explanation: 
Highest element of array a[] is 6.

Example 2:

Input:
5
1 2 3 4 5
Output:
5
Explanation: 
Highest element of array a[] is 5.
Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findPeakElement() which takes integer n, and the array a[] as the input parameters and returns the highest element of the array.

Expected Time Complexity: O(log(n))
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

Constraints:
2 <= n <= 106
1 <= a[i] <= 106



Solution :

class Solution {
public:
    int findPeakElement(vector<int>& a) 
    {
        
        int left = 0, right = a.size() - 1;

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            if (a[mid] < a[mid + 1]) {
                // We are in the increasing part of the array
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                // We are in the decreasing part of the array
                right = mid;
            }
        }

        // At the end of the while loop, left == right, pointing to the peak element
        return a[left];
    }
};
