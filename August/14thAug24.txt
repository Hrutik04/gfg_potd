Longest Common Substring

You are given two strings str1 and str2. Your task is to find the length of the longest common substring among the given strings.

Examples:

Input: str1 = "ABCDGH", str2 = "ACDGHR"
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest common substring is "CDGH" which has length 4.
Input: str1 = "ABC", str2 = "ACB"
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest common substrings are "A", "B", "C" all having length 1.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n*m).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n*m).

Constraints:
1<= str1.size(), str2.size()<=1000
Both strings may contain upper and lower case alphabets.
